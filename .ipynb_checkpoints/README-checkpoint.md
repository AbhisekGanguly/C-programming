# Journaling my C programming journey.
Before starting I'd like to mention that __I've provious programming knowledge__ and I'm a very _proficient_ __Python programmer__. How I approach and interprete problems will surely be __different__ from people who are __completely new to programming and/or problem solving__. To them I would advice to have a little knowledge about problem solving and computational thinking before beginning with this __C programming journal__.

## 01 Getting started with C
### Concept 1: Comment
In this part we'll discuss about comments in programming. 
* Comment is basically how you _document and enhance the readability of your code._ 
* Comment is important because if you were to write and maintain a code, adding comment will help you or anyone else reading understand the program, what different pieces of code does.
* All comments are ignored by the compiler. It the syntax of the comment if solloewd correctly, it can be used anywhere in the code to explain it. The compiler won't throw any error.
So comments are really useful as it helps us _explain and document our code for us and others to understand._ It can also save a significant amount of time which otherwise will be used up in understanding the code again!
