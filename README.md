# Journaling my C programming journey.
Before starting I'd like to mention that __I've provious programming knowledge__ and I'm a very _proficient_ __Python programmer__. How I approach and interprete problems will surely be __different__ from people who are __completely new to programming and/or problem solving__. To them I would advice to have a little knowledge about problem solving and computational thinking before beginning with this __C programming journal__.

## 01 Getting started with C
### Concept 1: Comment
In this part we'll discuss about comments in programming. 
* Comment is basically how you _document and enhance the readability of your code._ 
* Comment is important because if you were to write and maintain a code, adding comment will help you or anyone else reading understand the program, what different pieces of code does.
* All comments are ignored by the compiler. It the syntax of the comment if solloewd correctly, it can be used anywhere in the code to explain it. The compiler won't throw any error.
So comments are really useful as it helps us _explain and document our code for us and others to understand._ It can also save a significant amount of time which otherwise will be used up in understanding the code again!

#### Sub-section: Uses of comment
Now there's something known as too much comment.
* Adding too many comment can lead to degradeing readability of the program instead of improving!
* You have to use the comment intelligently.
It is a good idea to get into the habit of commenting on the top of the code file explaing the problem the code is being written to solve. Always remember:
* It's easier to comment when the piece of code is still fresh in your mind and you understand the logic.
* Reap the usage of comment when it comes to debugging, by commenting you can easily seggeregate a piece of code and understand the logic and phases of program.
* A comment can help you read through a program, but it can also help you point at the source of the logic mistake.
* You should try and comment different section of code with different kind of work it does - like what the loops are for, what is the function used in here does, etc.
* Whenever commenting, use self documenting comments with meaningful names that matches with the description and will be easier to understand in the future.
